# ***Revisions and the cloud*** 
 explaning several aspects of version control in order to explain ***Git***.

 ### 3. **Distributed Version Control** 
 addressing the major vulnerability of the ***CVS*** as a single point of failure. in case CVS gose down collaborators ***cannot*** 
 worke with each other. 
 ***DVCS*** prevent this type pf catastrophic loss which allow the client **creat mirrored repositories** .
